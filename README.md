# PasswordGeneratorAndManager
Secure Password Generator and Manager. 
Key competencies:Python, 

Features: 
1. Enter a desired password length
2. Checklist of password requirements (special chars, capital letters, numbers, etc.)
3. Passwords are not saved locally, but reproduced identically everytime based on the password requirements entered

Possible application:

Made into a chrome extension with a clean drop-down interface.
	Potential Issues:	- What parameters would the user need to enter?
					- Auto-retreive username website (and maybe password requirements?), user enters a master password & ....
				- Is it simple to use?
				- Needs to be seemless

	Meeting Minutes:
		- Competitors front end - Lastpass, ...
		- How to structure implementation - For V1. Just a chrome extension where inputs are all manual
		- What features will make us stand out - Simplicity
